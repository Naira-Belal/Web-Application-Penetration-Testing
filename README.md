# Web-Application-Penetration-Testing
- - -
## Objective
Perform penetration testing on a web application to identify and exploit 
common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- - -
## Project Timeline
 Week 1: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance
  - Task: Gather information about the target web application using passive reconnaissance techniques (OSINT).
  - Deliverables: Reconnaissance report detailing target technologies, potential entry points, and exposed data.
  
Week 2: Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation 
- Task: Identify common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS) and exploit them using tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap.
- Deliverables: Proof-of-concept exploitation for identified vulnerabilities,including screenshots and detailed attack vectors.

Week 3: Automated and Manual Testing
- Task: Use automated tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP) for vulnerability scanning and perform manual testing for business logic flaws.
- Deliverables: Detailed report on automated and manual findings, prioritized by severity.

Week 4: Reporting, Remediation Recommendations, and Presentation
- Task: Document vulnerabilities, provide remediation recommendations, and prepare a presentation to present findings to stakeholders.
- Deliverables: Comprehensive web application security report, including detailed 
steps for remediation. Final presentation summarizing the vulnerabilities, exploits, 
and suggested remediations
